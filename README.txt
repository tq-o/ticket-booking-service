Hi,
This is my Threads and Synchronization project based on Jimmy Fallon show.
I follow all the given requirements.
I have 3 semaphores to handle for synchronizations of the connected lines, the operator counting, and the id. 
I followed the steps of making a phone call to buy  a ticket as given in the description:
I will keep the caller who made a busy call line to make call for each 1 second.
And if the line has available spots (fewer or equal to 4), I will let them connect toan operator to buy a ticket.
I only allow the input in range 1 to 240 calls. For the semaphores, I destroy them all in the end.
My thread function will handle the calling tasks.

You will have to use UMass email to open it.

Thank you,
Thai.
